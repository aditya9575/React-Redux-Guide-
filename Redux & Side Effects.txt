As we know that in redux -> our Reducer function must be pure that takes input and produces an output without any side effects happening 
So now the question rises that where will the side effect come in place while using redex-> reducer function as in case of sending a http request on dispatching some action 

----------------------------------------------> We have two things :

OPTION A) we can put it inside the component directly using useEffect

OPTION B) We can write our own action creator functions
